# RNA-Seq & Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Irradiated Mouse Salivary Tissue

This project explores molecular changes in irradiated mouse salivary gland tissue using RNA-seq and metabolomics data. We perform differential gene expression analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment, with ongoing integration of metabolomics data and development of a formal technical white paper.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- âœ… **Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** from RNA-seq data using DESeq2
- âœ… **Perform KEGG pathway enrichment** on DEGs using clusterProfiler
- ðŸ”„ **Integrate metabolomics data** using MetaboAnalystR (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ **Perform joint pathway analysis** across omics layers (in progress)
- ðŸ§¾ **Produce a professional white technical paper** documenting the full methodology and findings (in progress)
