# RNA-Seq & Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Irradiated Mouse Salivary Tissue

This project analyzes transcriptomic changes in irradiated mouse salivary gland tissue using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We perform differential gene expression analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment in both R and Python environments. The project culminates in a formal white paper comparing methodological pipelines across programming languages.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ **Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** from RNA-seq data using DESeq2 (R) and pyDESeq2 (Python)
- ✅ **Perform KEGG pathway enrichment** using clusterProfiler (R) and gprofiler-official (Python)
- ✅ **Compare R and Python pipelines** for RNA-seq analysis and visualization
- ✅ **Produce a professional white paper** documenting the full methodology, code, figures, and findings
